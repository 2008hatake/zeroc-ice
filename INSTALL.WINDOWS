======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Windows version
---------------

Ice has been extensively tested with Windows XP and Windows 2000. Ice
will most likely also work on Windows NT. Windows 95/98/ME is not
supported.

Ice binary distributions for Visual C++ .NET 2002 and 2003 are
also available from http://www.zeroc.com/download.html.


C++ compiler
------------

The following Microsoft Visual C++ compilers are supported:

- Visual C++ 6.0 with STLport 4.5

- Visual C++ .NET 2002 (aka VC 7.0)

- Visual C++ .NET 2003 (aka VC 7.1)

The STL (Standard Template Library) that is included with Visual C++
6.0 is not supported! You must use STLport 4.5 with Visual C++
6.0. You can download STLport 4.5 from:

http://www.stlport.org/download.html

For STLport installation instructions, please see:

http://www.stlport.org/doc/install.html

For Visual C++ .NET 2002 and 2003, you can use the included STL 
library. Downloading and installing STLport is not required for 
these compiler versions.


Third-party libraries
---------------------

- Berkeley DB 4.1

- expat 1.9x

- OpenSSL 0.96 or 0.97

- bzip2 1.0

You must install all these packages before proceeding with the
installation of Ice.

If you are using Visual C++ .NET 2002 or 2003, you can download
an installer for all these Ice dependencies from 
http://www.zeroc.com/download.html. 

You can download Berkeley DB from:
http://www.sleepycat.com/download

And expat from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

And OpenSSL from:
http://www.openssl.org

And bzip2 from:
http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2

Note: For a regular build of bzip2, both the debug and the release
library are named "libbz2.lib". In order to be able to have both a
debug and a release version on your system, please rename the debug
library to "libbz2d.lib". This is also what the Ice project files
expect if you build a debug version of Ice.

We recommend that you use the same Visual C++ version to build all
of the third party libraries.


Python 2.2
----------

To run the automated test suite, you will need Python 2.2. If you have
no interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required. You
can download a Python distribution for Windows from:

http://www.activestate.com


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Using your favorite Zip tool, unzip the Ice archive anywhere you
like. Then start the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE.

First, you must make sure that your compiler finds all the required
third-party packages (include files, libraries, and DLLs):

- In the IDE, choose:
  * Visual C++ 6.0: Tools->Options->Directories
  * Visual C++ .NET: Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories

- Select "Include files".

- Add the include directories for Berekeley DB, expat, OpenSSL,
  and bzip2.

  If you used the binary installer for expat, then the proper include
  directory is C:\Expat-1.95.6\Source\lib.

- If you're using STLport, also add the include files for STLport.
  (Note that you must add the include\stlport directory, not
  just "include".)

- Select "Library files".

- Add the library directories for Berkeley DB, expat, OpenSSL,
  bzip2, and STLport (if required).

  If you used the binary installer for expat, then the proper library
  directory is C:\Expat-1.95.6\Libs.

- Select "Executable files".

- Add the directories which contain DLLs for Berekeley DB, expat,
  OpenSSL, bzip2, and STLport (if required).

Now you're ready to compile Ice. Open the "all.dsw" workspace. If you
are using Visual C++ .NET, then the project files will first be
converted from Visual C++ 6.0 to .NET format.

Set your active project to either "all" or "minimal". "all" will
compile everything including tests and demos. "minimal" will not
compile tests and demos. To set your active project with Visual C++
6.0, use Project->Set Active Project. For Visual C++ .NET, click on
"all" or "minimal" in the class view, then use Project->Set as StartUp
Project.

To start the compilation, use Build->Build for Visual C++ 6.0, or
Build->Build all/minimal for Visual C++ .NET, respectively.

If you built the tests with "all", you can run the test suite,
provided that you have installed Python. Open a command prompt, and
change to the directory Ice-<version>. At the command prompt, execute:

python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok". In case of a
failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to add the "bin"
directory, which contains DLLs and executables, to your PATH.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Installation instructions for Visual Studio .NET 2002 and 2003
are provided in Ice-<version>\install\vc70\README and 
Ice-<version>\vc71\README.

No automatic installation support is provided for Visual C++ 6.0: you 
need to copy the contents of the bin, include, and lib directories 
by hand. The include directory contains all Ice include files, the 
lib directory all Ice libraries, and the bin directory all Ice 
executables and DLLs.

After installation, make sure to add the include directory to the
Visual C++ "Include files", the lib directory to the "Library files",
and the bin directory to the "Executable files". (Visual C++ 6.0:
Choose Tools->Options->Directories. Visual C++ .NET: Choose
Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories.)
