To run this demo, open two terminal windows. In the first window,
start the IceBox server:

$ icebox --Ice.Config=config

In the second window, run the client:

$ ./client

Note that, for icebox to be able to find the library containing the
service, you must add the current directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux)
or Path (Windows). Alternatively, you can copy libHelloService.{so,dll}
to a directory that is in the path.
