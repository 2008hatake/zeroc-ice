To run this demo, open three terminal windows. In the first window,
start the server:

$ ./server

In the second window, run the Glacier starter:

$ ../../../bin/glacierstarter --Ice.Config=config

In the third window, run the client:

$ ./client

You will be asked for a userid and a password. Any userid/password
combination with the password being the same as the userid will be
accepted (for example, userid="test" and password="test").
