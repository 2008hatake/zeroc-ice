To run this demo, open three terminal windows. In the first window,
start the server:

$ ./server

In the second window, run the Glacier starter (see NOTE below):

$ ../../../bin/glacierstarter --Ice.Config=config

In the third window, run the client:

$ ./client

You will be asked for a userid and a password. Any userid/password
combination with the password being the same as the userid will be
accepted (for example, userid="test" and password="test").

If no data is received from the client for a period of 60 seconds 
(this timeout is configurable) the glacier session will be terminated.
In order for more data to be sent it is required that a new session be
created by restarting the client and logging in again.

NOTE: The glacierstarter executable is not currently available on
Windows. You can still use this demo if you have a supported platform
on which to run glacierstarter.
