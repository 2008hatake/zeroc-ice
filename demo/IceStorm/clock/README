To run the demo:

$ export ICE_CONFIG=config

Or use --Ice.Config=config for all subsequent commands.

Start the IceStorm service:

$ ../../../bin/icebox --Ice.Config=config_service

This currently assumes there is a subdirectory named db in the current
working directory.

In a separate window:

$ ../../../bin/icestormadmin -e "create time"
$ ./subscriber

In another window:

$ ./publisher

Ten "tick" messages should be displayed in the subscriber window for
each run of the publisher.
