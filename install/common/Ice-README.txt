Building and running the C++ demos
----------------------------------

The C++ demos are in the demo directory.

To build a C++ demo, you just need to open demo\demo.sln in Visual
Studio .NET, right click on it in the Solution Explorer window and
select "Build". 

To run these demos, you need to add the Ice bin directory to your PATH,
for example:

set PATH=C:\Ice-1.1.1\bin;%PATH%

Then open a Command Prompt, cd to the desired demo subdirectory, and
type 'server' to start the server. In a separate Command Prompt window,
type 'client' to start the client.

Note that extra steps may be required when running the IceBox demo,
depending on how you compiled the demos. If you used the Release
configuration, then no extra steps are necessary. However, if you
used the Debug configuration, you will need to use the debug
version of icebox.exe located in the bin\debug subdirectory.

Building and running the Java demos
-----------------------------------

The Java demos are in the demoj directory.

To build the Java demos, you need the Java SDK 1.4.1 and Ant 1.5. They 
can be downloaded from:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

You also need to set the following environment variables:

set JAVA_HOME=<Java SDK installation root directory>
set ICE_HOME=<Ice installation root directory>
set PATH=%ICE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
set CLASSPATH=%ICE_HOME%\lib\Ice.jar;%ICE_HOME%\lib\db.jar;%CLASSPATH%

Then add the ant bin directory to your PATH, open a Command Prompt and 
type 'ant' in any demo subdirectory to build the corresponding Java 
demo.

To run a demo, open a Command Prompt, cd to the desired demo directory,
and enter the following command to run the server:

java -cp "classes;%CLASSPATH%" Server

In a separate Command Prompt window, enter the following command to
run the client:

java -cp "classes;%CLASSPATH%" Client
