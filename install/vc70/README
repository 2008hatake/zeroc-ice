Installer for Visual Studio .NET 2002 aka VC 7.0:
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a Visual Studio .NET 2002 solution to
create Microsoft Windows Installers (.msi) for Ice and the
third party products Ice depends on.

These projects were created with all the source distributions
installed in C:\builds; the Ice source distribution was 
installed in C:\builds\ice and the IceJ source distribution
was installed in c:\builds\icej. If you use a different directory
structure, you may need to adjust some paths in the project files.

The solution has two configurations:
 - ThirdParty, to build the ThirdParty.msi and ThirdPartyPDB.msi 
   installers from source distributions of Berkeley DB, 
   bzip2/libbzip2, OpenSSL and Xerces-C++. All the source 
   distributions must be built with both Debug and Release 
   configurations, except OpenSSL (release only). This configuration 
   also generates Merge Modules (.msm files) for these products in 
   the MergeModules directory.

 - Ice, to build the Ice.msi and IcePDB.msi installers from Ice and 
   IceJ source distributions, and merge modules for Berkeley DB, 
   OpenSSL and Xerces-C++. Ice must be built with both Debug and 
   Release configurations; IceJ should be built with optimize set to
   on. The required merge modules can be either created through 
   the ThirdParty configuration (which requires building the
   corresponding source distributions) or downloaded from
   http://www.zeroc.com/download.html
