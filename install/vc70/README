Installer for Visual Studio .NET 2002 aka VC 7.0:
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a Visual Studio .NET 2002 solution to
create Microsoft Windows Installers (.msi) for Ice and the
third party products Ice depends on.

These projects were created with all the source distributions
installed in C:\builds; the Ice source distribution was 
installed in C:\builds\ice, the IceJ source distribution
was installed in c:\builds\icej and the IceCs source distribution
was installed in C:\builds\icecs. If you use a different directory
structure, you will need to adjust some paths in the project files.

The solution has two configurations:
 - ThirdParty, to build the ThirdParty.msi and ThirdPartyPDB.msi 
   installers from source distributions of Berkeley DB, 
   bzip2/libbzip2, OpenSSL and Expat. All the source distributions 
   must be built with both Debug and Release configurations, except 
   OpenSSL and Expat (release only). This configuration also 
   generates Merge Modules (.msm files) for these products in 
   the MergeModules directory.

 - Ice, to build the Ice.msi and IcePDB.msi installers from Ice and 
   IceJ source distributions, and merge modules for Berkeley DB, 
   OpenSSL and Expat. Ice must be built with both Debug and Release 
   configurations; IceJ should be built with optimize set to on; 
   IceCs should be built debug only, with Visual C# 7.1.
   The merge modules for the third party dependencies can be either
   created through the ThirdParty configuration (which requires 
   building the corresponding source distributions) or downloaded from
   http://www.zeroc.com/download.html
