======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Operating System
----------------

Solaris 8 or Solaris 9 on SPARC.

You also need to have /dev/urandom installed. This is the default with
Solaris 9; on Solaris 8, you need to install patch 112438-01.


C++ compiler
------------

The following Sun compilers are supported:

- Sun C++ 5.4 (part of Sun ONE Studio 7.0 aka Forte Developer 7).

- Sun C++ 5.5 (part of Sun ONE Studio 8.0). Ice takes advantage of the
  new linker scoping feature to reduce the number of symbols exported
  by Ice shared libraries.


Third-party libraries
---------------------

- Berkeley DB 4.1.25 or 4.2.52 with C++ support enabled, and built 
  with a C++ compiler compatible with the one you are using.

- expat 1.9x

- OpenSSL 0.97

- bzip2 1.0

Berkeley DB can be downloaded from:
http://www.sleepycat.com/download

expat can be downloaded from:
http://www.sunfreeware.com
Or from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

OpenSSL 0.97 can be downloaded (in binary form) from:
http://www.sunfreeware.com
Or you can download the source from:
http://www.openssl.org

bzip2 may already be installed on your system. If not, we recommend to
download it (in binary form) from http://www.sunfreeware.com.


GNU Make 3.80
-------------

GNU Make 3.80 is required to build Ice on SPARC/Solaris. You can
download GNU Make from http://www.sunfreeware.com.


Python 2.2
----------

To run the automated test suite, you will need Python 2.2. If you have
no interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required. You
can download Python from http://www.sunfreeware.com.


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Extract the Ice archive in any directory you like (for example, in
your home directory):

$ tar xvfz Ice-<version>.tar.gz

Change the working directory to Ice-<version>:

$ cd Ice-<version>

Edit the file config/Make.rules according to the comments in this
file. Make sure that the paths for the third-party libraries are set
correctly if they are not installed in the default location /usr/lib
and /usr/include.

Now you're ready to build Ice:

$ gmake

This will build the Ice core library, all add-ons, all tests, and all
examples. 


CC 5.4 note
-----------

The Sun CC 5.4 build produces a large number of warnings about hidden
functions in the fstream and sstream standard headers. This is a known
Sun bug (#4852754). You can suppress them by removing the
corresponding '+w' option in config/Make.rules.SunOS, or by filtering
your build log file with a sed script such as:

# Workaround for bug 4852754
/SUNWspro/d
/While specializing "std::/d
/Where: Specialized in non-template code./d
/Warning(s) detected./d


After a successful build, you can run the test suite, provided that 
you installed Python:

$ gmake test

This is equivalent to:

$ python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok". In case of a
failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to add "bin" to
PATH and "lib" to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64 (for 64 bit
builds):

$ export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64


======================================================================
64 bit builds
======================================================================

To build Ice in 64 bit mode, you need to:

- Obtain or build all the third party dependencies, and put the 64 bit
  libraries in the "lib/sparcv9" directories. For example put Berkeley
  DB 64 bit libraries in $DB_HOME/lib/sparcv9.

- Set the environment variable LP64 to yes, e.g.:
  $ export LP64=yes

- Build and test as described above.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Simply run "gmake install". This will install Ice in the "prefix"
directory specified in the file Make.rules.

After installation, make sure that the <prefix>/bin directory is in
your PATH, and the <prefix>/lib directory is in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. When compiling Ice programs, you must also make sure
to pass the location of the <prefix>/include directory to the compiler
with the -I option, and the location of the <prefix>/lib directory
with the -L option.

If you built in 64 bit mode, the libraries are installed in
<prefix>/lib/sparcv9 and the programs are installed in
<prefix>/bin/sparcv9. Other files are identical for 32 and 64 bit.
