======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Operating System
----------------

FreeBSD 5.1 for Intel x86.

C++ compiler
------------

- GCC 3.3


Third-party libraries
---------------------

- Berkeley DB 4.1.25 or 4.2.52 configured with --enable-cxx

- expat 1.9x

- OpenSSL 0.96 or 0.97

- bzip2 1.0

- readline and ncurses (optional, but used unless you set USE_READLINE
  to no in config/Make.rules)

Berkeley DB, expat, OpenSSL, bzip2, readline and ncurses are usually 
available with your FreeBSD distribution.

If you don't have them, you can download Berkeley DB from:
http://www.sleepycat.com/download

And expat from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat

And OpenSSL from:
http://www.openssl.org

And bzip2 from:
http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2

And readline from:
http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html

And ncurses from:
http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html


Python 2.2 or 2.3
-----------------

To run the automated test suite, you will need Python. If you have
no interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required.


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Extract the Ice archive in any directory you like (for example, in
your home directory):

$ tar xvfz Ice-<version>.tar.gz

Change the working directory to Ice-<version>:

$ cd Ice-<version>

Edit the file config/Make.rules according to the comments in this
file. Make sure that the paths for the third-party libraries are set
correctly if they are not installed in the default location /usr/lib
and /usr/include.

Now you're ready to build Ice:

$ make

This will build the Ice core library, all add-ons, all tests, and all
examples. After a successful build, you can run the test suite,
provided that you installed Python:

$ make test

This is equivalent to:

$ python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok". In case of a
failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to add "bin" to
PATH and "lib" to LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

$ export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Simply run "make install". This will install Ice in the "prefix"
directory specified in the file Make.rules.

After installation, make sure that the <prefix>/bin directory is in
your PATH, and the <prefix>/lib directory is in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. When compiling Ice programs, you must also make sure
to pass the location of the <prefix>/include directory to the compiler
with the -I option, and the location of the <prefix>/lib directory
with the -L option.
